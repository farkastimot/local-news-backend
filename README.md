# Local News Backend

This is the backend for the second sprint of our very own news website.

This repo started at the second sprint as in the first sprint we used an external api.

This is a ASP.NET API project which focuses on creating an api dedicated to serving a website based on react with news articles.
You can find the frontend part of this project at: github.com/farkastimot/local-news-frontend
